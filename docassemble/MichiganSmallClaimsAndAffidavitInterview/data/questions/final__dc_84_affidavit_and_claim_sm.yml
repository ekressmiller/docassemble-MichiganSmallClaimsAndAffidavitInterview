  Sometimes a contract benefits someone who is not part of the agreement.

  That person is called a "third-party beneficiary." If you buy a car for your adult child, you are a party to the sales agreement. Your child is the "third-party beneficiary." You can sue the person who sold you the car in Small Claims Court based on the sales contract, but your child cannot.

  Sometimes, the right to collect a debt is sold or transferred. Creditors do this when they sell debts to collection agencies. A collection agency is not a party to the original transaction, and cannot sue a debtor in Small Claims Court.

  Completing this process does not file your forms with the court
subquestion: |
  You need to file them at court in person, by mail, e-mail, or by e-filing.

  Read the instructions that you will get with your forms for more information.

  ${ collapse_template(am_i_going_to_efile) }

  This tool will create separate forms so you can more easily e-file using MiFILE, if you plan to e-file.

  This means that **you may need to download multiple files to get all of the forms you will need**. At the end of this interview you will see a list of documents to download. Make sure you download each of them. 

  You will also be able to get all forms you need by clicking the **Download Your Form(s)** button on the page at the end of this tool.

  Not all courts offer e-filing at this time. To find out if your court has e-filing, read the
  [What is E-Filing?](https://michiganlegalhelp.org/resources/mifile/what-e-filing) article.
  The article tells you how to find out which courts have e-filing and what kinds of cases those courts are accepting by e-filing.

  Look for the two-letter case type code at the end of your case number.
  (This could be DM, DC, DS, DP, or a different code.)
