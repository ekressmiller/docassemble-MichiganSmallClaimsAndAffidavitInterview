question: |
  Before you can start the claim, we will ask you some questions to make sure Small Claims Court is the right place for your case.
subquestion: |
  There are some special rules in Small Claims Court. Carefully read the list below so that you can make sure this process is right for you. In small claims:
   
  1. Neither side can have a lawyer. This includes not being allowed to get help from a lawyer if you win the case and you need to collect the judgment.
  1. You can only ask for money. If you want to ask for something of yours to be returned -- like your car or your dog -- you might be able to use a claim and delivery case. You can [search for a lawyer](https://michiganlegalhelp.org/resources/going-court/limited-scope-representation-lsr-more-affordable-way-hire-lawyer) or use the [Claim and Delivery](https://www.courts.michigan.gov/4a6ed0/siteassets/forms/scao-approved/mc35.pdf) court form. 
  1. You can only ask for up to $6500. If the other person owes more than $6500, you can still use small claims, but the court can only order up to $6500 in the judgment. If you want to ask for more, you can search for a lawyer to help you or use the [SCAO forms page](https://www.courts.michigan.gov/SCAO-forms/) to find out if there is a form for your kind of case.
  1. You can't appeal decisions in Small Claims Court unless the court has a magistrate on the case. If a magistrate makes the decision in your case, you are allowed to make a very limited appeal to a Small Claims judge.
  1. You can't have a jury trial.

  Sometimes a contract helps someone who is not part of the contract.

  That person is called a "third-party beneficiary." If you buy a car for your adult child, you are on the sales agreement. Your child is the "third-party beneficiary." **You** can sue the person who sold you the car in Small Claims Court based on the sales contract, but your child cannot.

  Sometimes, the right to collect a debt is sold or transferred. Creditors do this when they sell debts to collection agencies. A collection agency is not a party to the original transaction and cannot sue a debtor in Small Claims Court.

  **What if I want to sue for more than $7,000?**
content: |
  You can only get up to $7,000 in Small Claims Court. You can continue with your case even if you're asking for more money, but you won't be able to get more than $7,000.

  If you want to sue for more than $7,000, you should file a claim in District Court.

  You may want to talk to a lawyer about starting a case in District Court. You can use the [Guide to Legal Help](https://michiganlegalhelp.org/guide-to-legal-help)  on Michigan Legal Help to find a lawyer or a legal services office near you.

  If a person is unable to represent themselves in court, someone else might be able to do it for that person. A guardian is appointed by a probate court to make personal decisions for someone. These include day-to-day decisions, such as those involving health care and education. A conservator is appointed by a probate court to care for the personal property and finances of a person. A next friend is a concerned person, usually a relative, appointed by a court who can appear in court for a child or incapacitated adult.
