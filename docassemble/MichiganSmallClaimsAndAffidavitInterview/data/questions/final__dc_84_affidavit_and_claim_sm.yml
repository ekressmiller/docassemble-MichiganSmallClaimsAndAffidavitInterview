help: |
  Sometimes a contract benefits someone who is not part of the agreement.

  That person is called a "third-party beneficiary." If you buy a car for your adult child, you are a party to the sales agreement. Your child is the "third-party beneficiary." You can sue the person who sold you the car in Small Claims Court based on the sales contract, but your child cannot.

  Sometimes, the right to collect a debt is sold or transferred. Creditors do this when they sell debts to collection agencies. A collection agency is not a party to the original transaction, and cannot sue a debtor in Small Claims Court.
